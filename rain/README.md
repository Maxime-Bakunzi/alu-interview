# Rainwater Retention

This project implements a Python function to calculate the amount of rainwater retained between walls represented by their heights. Given a list of non-negative integers representing the heights of walls with unit width 1, as if viewing the cross-section of a relief map, the `rain` function calculates how many square units of water will be retained after it rains.

## Requirements

### General

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.4.3)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the PEP 8 style (version 1.7.x)
- You are not allowed to import any module
- All modules and functions must be documented
- All your files must be executable

## Usage

To use this project, you can include the `rain` function in your Python script. The function takes a list of non-negative integers representing wall heights and returns the total amount of rainwater retained.

```python
from rainwater_retention import rain

walls = [0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 3, 0, 4]
retained_water = rain(walls)
print(f"Total retained water: {retained_water} units")
```

## Function Description

The `rain` function accepts a single argument:

- `walls` (list): A list of non-negative integers representing the heights of walls with unit width 1.

The function returns an integer indicating the total amount of rainwater retained.

## Examples

### Example 1:

```python
walls = [0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 3, 0, 4]
retained_water = rain(walls)
print(f"Total retained water: {retained_water} units")
```

Output:
```
Total retained water: 6 units
```

### Example 2:

```python
walls = [2, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 1, 0]
retained_water = rain(walls)
print(f"Total retained water: {retained_water} units")
```

Output:
```
Total retained water: 6 units
```
