# Pascal's Triangle

This Python project provides a function for generating Pascal's triangle and printing it as a list of lists of integers.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pascals-triangle.git
    ```

2. Change into the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd pascals-triangle
    ```

3. Run the sample program to generate and print Pascal's triangle for a specific value of `n`:

    ```bash
    python 0-main.py
    ```

4. You can also use the `pascal_triangle` function in your own code by importing it from the `0-pascal_triangle.py` module.

## Function

### `pascal_triangle(n)`

This function returns Pascal's triangle as a list of lists of integers for a given integer `n`.

- Returns an empty list if `n` is less than or equal to 0.
- You can assume `n` will always be an integer.

## Sample Output

For `n = 5`, running the sample program (`0-main.py`) will print Pascal's triangle as follows:

[1]
[1,1]
[1,2,1]
[1,3,3,1]
[1,4,6,4,1]
